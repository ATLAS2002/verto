Welcome! üëãüèº

**Verto** is an initiative to curate a list of accessible issues from popular projects, so developers looking for a new (or first) project to contribute to can get started quickly.

Open-source maintainers are always looking to get more people involved, but it can be challenging to become a contributor. We believe Verto lowers the barrier for future contributions - and this is why it exists.

## Adding a new project

You're welcome to add a new project in Verto, just follow these steps:

- To maintain the quality of projects in Verto, please make sure the repository you want to add meets the following criteria:

  - For **GitHub** repositories: it has at least three issues with the `good first issue` label or other labels defined in [config.json](config.json) (see `labels` and the end of the `GitHub` provider).

  - For **GitLab** repositories: it has at least three issues with the `quick win` label or other labels defined in [config.json](config.json) (see `labels` and the end of the `GitLab` provider).

  - It has at least 10 contributors.

  - It has at least 1000 stars.

  - It contains a README.md with detailed setup instructions for the project, and a CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for new contributors.

  - It is actively maintained (last update less than 1 month ago).

- For **GitHub** repositories: add your repository's path (in the format `owner/name` and lexicographic order) to [config.json](config.json) inside the `GitHub` provider.

- For **GitLab** repositories: add your repository's id (in the format `<project path>|<project id>`) to [config.json](config.json) inside the `GitLab` provider.

- Create a new pull-request. Please add the link to the issues page of the repository in the PR description. Once the pull request is merged, the changes will be live on [verto.dev](https://verto.dev/).

## Help us grow

Navigating open-source projects can be quite overwhelming for begineers and experienced contributers alike. Verto looks to solve this problem by providing a platform that serves as a starting point for those looking to get started with open-source or those who are looking to get into a new project.

The more people who know about [Verto](http://verto.dev), the better. There are various ways you can help us grow: you could contribute to `awesome` lists, blog about us, reach out to bloggers, tech influencers, developer and open-source on Twitter and YouTube, for example. Try and get [Verto](http://verto.dev/) mentioned in a video or tweet!

## How does it work?

Verto is a static website that uses Next.js, React and Typescript. The data shown on the website is loaded from the [data.json](data/data.json) file, which is generated by [data/get.ts](data/get.ts) by querying the GitHub API to fetch issues from the repositories listed in [config.json](config.json). The labels defined in [config.json](config.json) are used to filter issues for the repositories.

## How to Setup the Project Locally

To contribute new features and changes to the website, you would want to run the app locally. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository, clone it locally, create a new branch to work on a specific feature or bug fix without affecting the main branch of the repository. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer.
2. You can use the included [data.json](data/data.json) as dummy data or you can run `npm run prebuild` to fetch the latest data from GitHub yourself: for this, you will need to set the `GH_PAT` environment variable to a valid GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). Notice: repositories not maching the criteria listed above (see rules in [data.json](data/data.json)are automatically removed from [config.json](config.json) when the [data.json]data/data.json) script runs.
3. Start the development server and open the app in your browser.

```bash
# install the dependencies
$ npm install
# start the development server
$ npm run dev
```

Good to know when you commit: the project contains a `pre-commit` hook that runs linters automatically to ensure code quality!

**Note**: this project requires at least NodeJS 18.
