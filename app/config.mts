      I'm Luca Cavallin, a Software Engineer at GitHub Actions and a solopreneur. My professional focus is on distributed systems, developer and infrastructure tooling, and platform engineering. My work frequently involves Go, Rust, Kubernetes, serverless technologies, and the broader Cloud Native domain. I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by the newsletter I run, my blog posts, and talks. Additionally, I hold the title of Google Developer Expert (GDE). Outside of work, activities like cycling, using a kamado for cooking, stargazing, and attending to my cats keep me occupied.
